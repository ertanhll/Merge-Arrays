Write a C program that merges two arrays in ascending order.

The program should prompt the user to enter elements for the first array and store them in an array A. The user should indicate the end of input by entering -1.
Similarly, the program should prompt the user to enter elements for the second array and store them in an array B. Again, the end of input should be indicated by entering -1.
The program should then merge the elements of arrays A and B into a new array C in ascending order.
The merged array C should be printed to the console.
Ensure that the program handles arrays of up to 20 elements and that it terminates input when the user enters -1
